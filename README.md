# Task-3-Library-Management-System

# 📚 Library Management System (Java OOP Project)

## 📝 Description

This is a simple **Library Management System** built using **Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It is a console-based mini project that demonstrates the use of multiple classes, encapsulation, and object interactions to manage books and users in a library.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Add books and users
- Issue books to users
- Return issued books
- View all books and their issued status
- Menu-driven command-line interface

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **VS Code** (or any Java IDE)
- **Command Line / Terminal**

---

## 🧩 Project Structure

LibraryManagementSystem/
│
├── Book.java # Book class representing a library book
├── User.java # User class representing a library user
├── Library.java # Library class containing the logic for issuing and returning
└── Main.java # Main class with the user interface (menu)


---

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LibraryManagementSystem.git
   cd LibraryManagementSystem
Compile the Java Files


📌 Sample Menu
1. Show Books
2. Issue Book
3. Return Book
4. Exit

   
✅ Object-Oriented Concepts Demonstrated
Encapsulation – Use of private fields and getters/setters
Abstraction – Clean separation of logic between classes
Composition – Library class uses Book and User objects
Modularity – Multi-class, well-organized project structure
